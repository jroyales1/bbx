        [This website is to be used as a guideline to introduce someone into the beatbox scene and show how beatboxing could be applied to music in a catchy and convenient manner. The website will include other beatboxers, events, and basic sounds that are found in most songs created. Beatboxing has been seen as a niche hobby or skill, but it’s not often seen as a way to replicate musical genres with only using the mouth. Beatboxing has also been looked down upon in social media, with many people mocking it in a silly manner. This website will also be used to clear up that assumption and show that beatboxing is a skill that has an infinite amount of potential, like all of music. There’s only one beatboxing channel on YouTube that has a large amount of attraction to the public, which is Swissbeatbox. This website will also be able to showcase the other “underground” beatbox events that go around, especially the ones that deserve more attention. This website will allow people to grow in a hobby that will impress others because music is magic. Beatboxing will be seen as music and will be able to connect others through the universal language.]

      <h3>[Beatboxers]</h3>
      <p>
        [There are many beatboxers around the world, ranging from many different cultures and ages. This page shows some of the popular beatboxers from around the world, which could be used to branch out to other lesser known beatboxers. Getting to know other beatboxers and liking many of them based on their style allows people to grow in the community. Beatboxing has a high amount of diversity with the amount of cultural influences and techniques that it includes. There’s also many different categories of beatboxing that widens the variety of the skill. Some of the categories include the loopstation, tag team, and crew categories. Loopstation uses a device that loops and alters the sound that’s inputted, creating tracks that sound like an actual song. Tag team includes two people beatboxing at the same time, with the crew category being the same, but with four or five people. The amount of variety and knowledge that comes and is shared by beatboxers from different countries and backgrounds allows the creativity of beatboxing to increase day by day. Beatboxing is still relatively young in terms of time, so the ceiling will be raised way further in the future. Getting to know beatboxers from along the years and seeing the styles evolve over time also shows how the complexity and structure can change suddenly.]

      <h3>[Sounds]</h3>
      <p>
        [This page shows the many sounds ranging from basic to advanced that many beatboxers use a lot that will make other people impressed. These sounds can range from a basic hi-hat sound to making a bass frequency with lip vibrations. Knowing a lot of sounds and being able to combine them to make a catchy and groovy beat is what music is all about. Being able to learn the basics that are found in sounds like percussion sounds and melodic instrumentals make beatboxing very effective when it comes to making music. People that produce music that don’t know how to beatbox could also use the skill to create a structure to make an actual track in a music software. People make different sounds every day and don’t realize that they can apply it to beatboxing, such as a bird sound or basic singing. There are many sounds that barely need any steps that are very helpful when it comes to beatboxing, allowing everyone to be able to learn the basic skills easily. Learning the harder sounds takes a lot more work and effort, but it feels very rewarding in the end. Once a sound is learned, it doesn’t need much application to remember how to do it.]
